Jake's Repository, the good stuff.
Hi there, my name is Jake and I'm new to coding, hopefully someday I can look back on this and see what a noob I once was. I like pasta, dogs and golf. I'm working at a bank right now (just started 5 months or so ago) and am excited to see what coding can do for me. Starting out with Python. Here goes nothing!
